# Coding Prep

Simulations were of the most common interview based questions I've encountered while interviewing for Data Scientist roles 

A lot of those required the use of numpy and random to simulate distributions, as well as calculate probabilities. Some also required the development of simple classifiers using only 1 variable. 

In here, I have listed a few of the questions I've encountered and how I've dealt with it 

### Things to know before data science interviews 

1. Basics of probability 
2. Central limit theorem, law of large numbers
3. Distributions- differentiate between binomial, Poisson, geometric, normal distributions 
4. Basics of statistics- Mean, Median, Mode, S.D., Standard error of mean, Confidence Intervals 
5. Hypothesis Testing - t-test implementations, ANOVA
6. A/B testing: very helpful resource (https://github.com/RobbieGeoghegan/AB_Testing/blob/master/AB_Testing.ipynb)
